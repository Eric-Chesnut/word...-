Word contract, generate a 4 letter "word" (maybe) on the polygon blockchain!
Use the result however you see fit. 
Each letter is picked with around the frequency they appear in appear in the english dictionary (hence why Z is twice as likely as Q).
The "word" doesn't exist until you claim it!
456976 possible combinations, but only 10001 will be created.
Most of the "words" created will be gibberish, but if you're lucky you may just get a word, or a Q or two!
